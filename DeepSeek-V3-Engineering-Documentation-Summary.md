## Phase 2: Advanced MoE Architecture Implementation

### 2.1 DeepSeekMoE Architecture (256 Routed + 1 Shared Experts)

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
class DeepSeekMoELayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    """Advanced MoE with fine-grained experts and shared expert"""
    
    def __init__(self, d_model, d_ff, num_routed_experts=256, 
                 num_shared_experts=1, top_k=8):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Shared experts (always activated)
        self.shared_experts = [self._create_expert() for _ in range(num_shared_experts)]
        
        # Routed experts (selectively activated)  
        self.routed_experts = [self._create_expert() for _ in range(num_routed_experts)]
        
        # Expert centroids for routing
        self.expert_centroids = self.add_weight(
            shape=(num_routed_experts, d_model),
            initializer='random_normal'
        )
        
        # Bias for auxiliary-loss-free load balancing
        self.expert_biases = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(num_routed_experts), trainable=False)
```

**Key Features:**
- Fine-grained expert segmentation for better specialization
- Shared expert always activated for stable base computation
- Sigmoid-based routing instead of softmax for better load balancing
- Expert centroids learned during training for natural clustering

### 2.2 Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing

**Bias-Based Load Balancing:**
```python
def update_expert_bias(self, expert_loads, target_load, update_rate=1e-3):
    """Update expert bias based on load imbalance without gradients"""
    load_errors = expert_loads - target_load
    bias_updates = -update_rate * tf.sign(load_errors)
    self.expert_biases.assign_add(bias_updates)
```

**Advantages:**
- No gradient interference with main language modeling objective
- Preserves causality unlike Expert Choice routing
- Simple and effective without auxiliary loss hyperparameter tuning
- Reduces routing collapse while maintaining performance

### 2.3 Expert Parallelism Strategy

**64-Way Expert Parallelism:**
- Distribute 256 experts across 8 nodes (32 experts per node)
- All-to-all communication for expert routing
- Node-limited routing to reduce communication overhead
- Custom communication kernels for efficiency

### 2.4 Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Implementation

**Sequential Token Prediction:**
```python
class MultiTokenPredictionHead(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    """MTP head for inference acceleration"""
    
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, num_predict_tokens=4):
        super().__init__()
        self.prediction_heads = [
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size) 
            for _ in range(num_predict_tokens)
        ]
    
    def call(self, hidden_states):
        predictions = []
        for head in self.prediction_heads:
            pred = head(hidden_states)
            predictions.append(pred)
        return tf.stack(predictions, axis=1)  # [batch, num_tokens, vocab]
```

**Benefits:**
- 1.8x inference speedup with 85-90% token acceptance rates
- Reduced autoregressive generation overhead
- Compatible with speculative decoding techniques

    """GRPO loss without value function"""
    ratio = tf.exp(policy_logprobs - ref_logprobs)
    clipped_ratio = tf.clip_by_value(ratio, 0.8, 1.2)
    loss = -tf.minimum(ratio * advantages, clipped_ratio * advantages)
