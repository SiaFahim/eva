- Document architectural decisions before coding
- Explain mathematical foundations clearly
- Provide AI coder implementation guidelines

### 3. Modular Implementation
- Develop components independently
- Maintain clear interfaces
- Enable parallel development where possible

### 4. Continuous Validation
- Test components as they're developed
- Benchmark performance regularly
- Validate integration continuously

## AI Coder Guidelines

### Implementation Best Practices

1. **Follow the Task Breakdown:** Use the detailed task breakdown in `Phase-1-Task-Breakdown.md` for systematic implementation
2. **Reference Implementation Guides:** Each component has detailed implementation guidance with code examples
3. **Test Early and Often:** Implement unit tests alongside each component
4. **Validate Performance:** Use benchmarking frameworks to ensure performance targets are met
5. **Document Decisions:** Explain architectural choices and mathematical foundations

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Comprehensive Docstrings:** All functions and classes must have detailed docstrings
2. **Type Hints:** Use proper type hints for all function parameters and returns
3. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and input validation
4. **Performance Optimization:** Write efficient code suitable for production deployment
5. **Testing Integration:** Ensure all code is thoroughly tested with synthetic data

### Educational Value

1. **Clear Explanations:** Code should be self-documenting with clear variable names
2. **Mathematical Context:** Include comments explaining mathematical operations
3. **Learning Progression:** Ensure implementations support the educational notebook structure
4. **Production Readiness:** All code should be suitable for adaptation to real deployment
